# CORS Solution Implementation

## Problem
The frontend was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when making direct API calls to the backend at `http://192.168.56.1:5000/api`.

## Solution
Implemented a Next.js API proxy to handle all backend communications and resolve CORS issues.

## Implementation

### 1. Created API Proxy Route
- **File**: `src/app/api/proxy/[...path]/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Acts as a proxy between the frontend and backend
- **Features**:
  - Handles all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS)
  - Properly forwards request headers (including Authorization)
  - Handles both JSON and FormData requests
  - Adds CORS headers to all responses
  - Handles preflight OPTIONS requests

### 2. Updated Environment Configuration
- **File**: `.env.local`
- **Changes**:
  - `BACKEND_API_URL=http://192.168.56.1:5000/api` (used by proxy)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api/proxy` (used by frontend)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=false`

### 3. Simplified Next.js Configuration
- **File**: `next.config.ts`
- **Changes**: Removed CORS configuration as it's now handled by the proxy

## How It Works

1. **Frontend Request**: Frontend makes API calls to `/api/proxy/*`
2. **Proxy Processing**: Next.js API route receives the request
3. **Backend Forwarding**: Proxy forwards the request to `http://192.168.56.1:5000/api/*`
4. **Response Handling**: Proxy adds CORS headers and returns response to frontend

## Benefits

- ✅ **No CORS Errors**: All requests are same-origin from the browser's perspective
- ✅ **Transparent**: Frontend code doesn't need to change
- ✅ **Secure**: Authorization headers are properly forwarded
- ✅ **Flexible**: Supports all HTTP methods and content types
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Works in both development and production builds

## API Endpoints

All backend endpoints are now accessible through the proxy:
- `GET /api/proxy/features` → `GET http://192.168.56.1:5000/api/features`
- `POST /api/proxy/auth/login` → `POST http://192.168.56.1:5000/api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/proxy/features` → `POST http://192.168.56.1:5000/api/features`
- And so on...

## Testing Results

- ✅ Build successful with no errors
- ✅ Development server running without issues
- ✅ API calls working through proxy
- ✅ No CORS errors in browser console
- ✅ Features loading successfully
- ✅ ESLint passes with no warnings
